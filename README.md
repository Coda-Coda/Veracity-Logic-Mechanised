# Veracity Logic Mechanised [DRAFT]

This repository contains **work in progress** on mechanising a logic for Veracity in [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) and [Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/).

The veracity logic mechanised in Coq is best viewed at: https://coda-coda.github.io/Veracity-Logic-Mechanised

Please see https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06164 for more information.

More to come soon!

## Codespaces + VSCoq (using this repository from just a web-browser)

*Note: Codespaces have free quotas but are not free in general, for more information see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces).*

1. [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Coda-Coda/Veracity-Logic-Mechanised) or [resume your existing Codespace](https://codespaces.new/Coda-Coda/Veracity-Logic-Mechanised?quickstart=1). It should take about 5 minutes to create a new Codespace, resuming an existing Codespace should be quicker.
2. Open a `.v` file (in the `/Coq` sub-folder) and use the keyboard shortcuts `Alt+UpArrow` and `Alt+DownArrow` to step forward and back through the proofs, and `Alt+RightArrow` to step forward up to the cursor. On macOS use `Control+Option` instead of `Alt`.
3. Delete the Codespace once you are finished, to avoid being charged for [storage costs](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces). Ensure that you download or commit and push any changes you would like to keep before deleting the Codespace.
